# TestAutomationExample

This is an automation example by using Selenium Webdriver with Python language.

Project contains two main test scripts: TestLogin and TestKupondas

TestLogin has the code which provides you sign in to "nesine.com" betting website.
TestKupondas has the code which allows you to make a ready coupon from the Kupondas section.



Few Things That You Need to Do Before Run the Code:

1-) Sign up to website

2-) Change in your code the related places (email and password)

3-) Download the chromedriver.exe if you dont have in your computer and put it into "C:\" which I have done similar in my computer.

4-) Run the code and see the results :)



Note: In this example we mostly focus on reaching the element by XPath. You can generate more function in this website and practice more about XPath as well
